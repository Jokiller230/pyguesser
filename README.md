Tiny Python networking demonstration for school. Using the [socket](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) module from Python's standard library.

## Dependencies
To run this program, you have to install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.13+ (Built and tested on, probably works with older releases too)

## Running the server
First an foremost, you have to start the server side of the application, this can be done by executing the `server_tcp.py` file.

```py
python src/server_tcp.py
```

## Connecting to the server
Once the server is up and running, you have to connect to it with a client, located in the `client_tcp.py` file.

```py
python src/client_tcp.py
```
